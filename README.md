Desktop Application for Near-Infrared (NIR) NPK modeling, purpose-built for the Raspberry Pi 4B platform and OceanView Flame Miniature Spectrometer. This tool is actively under development as part of an undergraduate research project, aiming to predict Organic Matter (OM), Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) levels with precision from soil spectra.

The main branch is only used to create the based of the Application on Windows. deploy-rpi-test is the working and final code for Raspberry Pi 4b 2Gb
